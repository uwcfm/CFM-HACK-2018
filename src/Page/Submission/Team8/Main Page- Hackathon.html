	<h2> 1. Shaw Communications Inc. Class B </h2>
	
	<p> Shaw is a company famous for their telecommunications services, which include freedom mobile. 
	    Over the years Shaw communications has stably developed and risen. Additionally, they have
		reported favourable financial data for the past few years and we think that it would continue that way.</p>

	<h2> 2. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited </h2>
	<p> Agnice Eagle Mines is a mining company based in Canada, and it has recently been given the go-ahead for
	a large project within the Agnice Hammond Reefs. Thus, we project that this news would allow the stock price to grow over the next 2 weeks.

	<h2> 3. Franco-Nevada Corp </h2>
	<p> Franco-Nevada has recently had many corporate investors up their stake within the company.

	<h2> 4. Alimentation Couche-Tard </h2>
	<p> Alimentation Couche-Tard is a retail grocery business and it has stability developed over the past year. 
	It has its second-quarter results releasing during the two-week time frame where the stocks are evaluated. 
	Quarter results have some of the largest influence on the short-time price of stocks and thus we choose it to have a large impact on our portfolio.

	<h2> 5. Suncor Energy </h2>
	<p> Suncor Energy is one of the largest energy companies in Canada. Which have a large share in the 
	Alberta oil sands. With the rise in oil prices, it would allow the company to make higher profits and 
	for investors to value the stock at much higher than what it is right now.
